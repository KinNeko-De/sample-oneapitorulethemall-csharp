#Order-Product Domain

Buyers are individuals who use the Kindatta Marketplace to browse and purchase desired products. Within the Order-Product domain, the Product entity serves as a reference to the specific items included in buyer orders. Ordering products can result in the creation of multiple orders, for example, when products are purchased from different sellers.
